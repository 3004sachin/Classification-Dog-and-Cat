# Cat and Dog Image Classification using CNN

## Overview
This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images as either cat or dog. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between cat and dog images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is gathered from Kaggle using the following API command: kaggle datasets download -d salader/dogs-vs-cats
This dataset consists of thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs, encompassing various cat and dog breeds.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- TensorFlow: Used for building and training the CNN model.
- Keras: High-level neural networks API, used for building the CNN architecture.
- OpenCV (cv2): Utilized for image preprocessing tasks such as reading and resizing images.
- Matplotlib: Used for visualizing training and validation metrics.

## Results
After training the model, it achieves a classification accuracy of 90% on the validation dataset.
